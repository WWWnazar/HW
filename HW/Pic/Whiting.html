	You should brush your teeth twice a day fot three minutes. It shouldn't be too hard. You should change your toothbrush every three months. In your mouth you 
should move the brush gently up and down. After that, you need clean the outside of your teeth. Next, you should brush up on the bottom teeth and down on the top teeth. 
You should not brush from side to side. Sweets, sugary snaks and fizzy drinks are very bad for your teeth. You should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Remember: 
You should go to a dentist twice a year. Use dental floss. The brush cannot completely clean the mouth, especially in hard-to-reach places.
	If you follow these rules, you will have good teeth.
